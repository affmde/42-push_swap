## ![description icon](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/32/2644/2644332.png) Description
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

## ![rules icon](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/32/3251/3251383.png) Rules

* You have 2 stacks named a and b.
* At the beginning:
    * The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.
    * The stack b is empty.
* The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the following operations at your disposal:
    * sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
        Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
    * sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
        Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
    * ss : sa and sb at the same time.
    * pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
        Do nothing if b is empty.
    * pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
        Do nothing if a is empty.
    * ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
        The first element becomes the last one.
    * rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
        The first element becomes the last one.
    * rr : ra and rb at the same time.
    * rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
        The last element becomes the first one.
    * rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
        The last element becomes the first one.
    * rrr : rra and rrb at the same time

## ![install icon](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/32/427/427132.png) Install and run


```bash
  $git clone https://github.com/affmde/42-push_swap.git
  $cd 42-push_swap
  $make
  $./push_swap (amout of numbers you want)
```
Replace the amount of number by the actual values you wish to insert. (parenthesis not required).
